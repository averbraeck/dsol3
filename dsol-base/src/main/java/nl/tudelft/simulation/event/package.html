	Provides classes and interfaces for asynchronous communication.
	<p />
	The event package is designed around three interfaces:
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>The EventListenerInterface defining callback mechanism for a listener.</li>
		<li>The EventProducerInterface defining registration capabilities.</li>
		<li>The EventInterface defining the events which are sent by a producer and received by a listener.</li>
	</ul>
	In this package, two aspects are of crucial importance. Operations defined in the interfaces throw a
	<code>RemoteException</code>
	. This makes the interfaces suitable for distributed deployment. The second aspect is concurrency. The classes
	providing a reference implementation of these interfaces are designed for multi-threaded deployment.
