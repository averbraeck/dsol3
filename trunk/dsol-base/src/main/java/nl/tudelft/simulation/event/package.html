Provides classes and interfaces for asynchronous communication.
<p>
	The event package is designed around three interfaces:
	<ul type="circle">
		<li> The EventListenerInterface defining callback mechamism for a listener.
		<li> The EventProducerInterface defining registration capabilities.
		<li> The EventInterface defining the events which are send by a producer and received by a listener. 
	</ul>
	In this package, two aspects are of crucial importance. Operations defined in the interfaces throw a <code>RemoteException</code>. This makes
	the interfaces suitable for distributed deployment. The second aspect is concurrency. The classes providing a reference implementation of these
	interfaces are designed for multi threaded deployment.
