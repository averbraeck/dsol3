 * <p>
 * The second example introduced in this section is again taken from Law &amp; Kelton. In this example we introduce a
 * retailer who sells a single product and would like to know how many items he should have in inventory for each of the
 * next <i>n</i> weeks. Both the conceptual model and its specification in DSOL represent a realistic supply chain
 * model.
