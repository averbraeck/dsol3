/**
 * Monitor class. In the Java programming language there is a lock associated with every object. The language does not
 * provide a way to perform separate lock and unlock operations; instead, they are implicitly performed by high-level
 * constructs that always arrange to pair such operations correctly. This Monitor class, however, provides separate
 * monitorenter and monitorexit instructions that implement the lock and unlock operations.
 * <p>
 * The class is final for now, as it is not the idea that the class should be extended. It has only static methods.
