    <release version="3.04.01" date="2020-01-23" description="New DJUTILS version; small update to AnimationPanel">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The DJUTILS version has been updated to 1.04.05.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Animation did not always show in applications or web applications. A check on whether the replication
        initialization event comes from the Simulator has been temporarily removed.  
      </action>

    <release version="3.04.00" date="2020-01-22" description="Event project to DJUTILS, new Context implementation">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="remove">
        The event project has been moved to the DJUTILS project and can be found as part of djutils. See 
        https://djutils.org/manual/djutils-project/event-package for more information. Much of the event package
        has been re-implemented and streamlined as part of the the transfer to DJUTILS.  
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        As a result of the transfer of the event project, all references to nl.tudelft.simulation.dsol.event.* had to 
        be changed to org.djutils.event.*
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The DJUNITS event project implements the EventProducer as an abstract class that needs a sourceId for firing events
        rather than exposing 'this' in each event. Therefore, the constructor of the classes that extend EventProducer
        had to be changed. 
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The DJUNITS event project forces the sourceId and content of an event, and the timestamp of a TimedEvent to be
        Serializable, because events are often streamed into a database. Several classes had to be updated to reflect
        this change.  
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The context package in the dsol-naming project has been completely re-implemented. The dependency on underlying 
        JNDI classes has been reduced, and the implementation is more lightweight than it was originally. The package 
        structure has been updated, and several of the classes have moved to new packages. Interfaces with a Name
        object have been removed; only the String representations have been re-implemented. Many of the other interfaces 
        of the new context implementation are the same as or similar to the original ones. The new Context implementation
        has been documented in https://simulation.tudelft.nl/dsol/manual/advanced/naming-context.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Rigid testing of the context package revealed many smaller and bigger mistakes (one of the reasons for
        re-implementing the entire package).
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        Unit tests have been included for the entire context package and dsol-naming project.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        A context demo has been added to the dsol-naming project under the test tree (DemoServer and DemoClient classes).
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The CategoryLogger in DJUTILS has been turned into a singleton rather than a static class. SimLogger implements a 
        logger with functionality of the CategoryLogger, but the logger is simulator-aware and can print the simulator time 
        as part of the log message.

    <release version="3.03.14" date="2019-11-17" description="Optimized differential equations; concurrent unit tests">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        Changed the short values for NumericalIntegrator into an Enum called NumericalIntegratorType. The constructors
        of all DifferentialEquation types have been adapted accordingly.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        Added test code for an ordinary differential equation, and for a stiff set of ODEs.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Repaired the Gill numerical integration method (formula wrongly implemented).
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        Added test code for the simulators using multi-threaded testing.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        An extended version of ConcurrentUnit for multi-threaded tests has been added to the test code to be able
        to test running simulators. See https://github.com/jhalterman/concurrentunit for more info. The original pom
        has not been included because it lacked several tests that we want to include here.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        Very extensive unit test for random number generators (bins, test on bit level, all drawing methods).
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Repaired the DX120 Random Number Generator (average draw was 0.25 instead of 0.5).

      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Repaired the nextInt(min, max) function in RandomNumberGenerator.

      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        Added unit tests for dsol-base project to increase test coverage. TestCase has been replaced by @Test.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        Updated the code for differential equations.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Fixed SphericalPoint in ots-base. The translation from a CartesianPoint to a SphericalPoint was wrong. Also,
        the arguments of the constructor of a SphericalPoint have been changed. The call is now:
        public SphericalPoint(final double radius, final double theta, final double phi)
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Extra equals() methods have been added to DirectedPoint and CartesianPoint in dsol-base. The Tuple3d from
        which these point types extends have an equals(Tuple3d) method that always wins from the equals(Object)
        method because it is more specific. Therefore the RotX, RotY and RotZ were not taken into account when 
        comparing two DirectedPoint objects.   
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        DirectedLine uses an embedded enum for Side instead of int.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        CompositeFilter uses an embedded enum for Operator instead of int.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        StateSaver uses byte[] instead of Object as that is the type in which data is stored. This has changed the 
        interface of StreamInterface in dsol-core.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Several small errors have been repaired in BitUtil in dsol-base.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="remove">
        Since the classes SwingWorker, ScreenManager and JMultiToolbarFrame are not used anymore in dsol, they
        have been removed from dsol-base.

      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Replaced FindBugs (which already had a problem supporting Java 8) with SpotBugs 
        (supporting later Java versions as well).

      <action dev="averbraeck" type="remove">
        Package nl.tudelft.simulation.dsol.web.peer in dsol-web removed, as this is an internal set

    <release version="3.03.07" date="2019-05-01" description="DEVSRealTimeClock animation 'jumps' repaired">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The 'jumps' that sometimes occurred in the animation of the DEVSRealTimeClock have been repaired.
        This was due to an accumulating error in the translation of short waits when no events were happening,
        which was corrected with a time jump when the next event was executed. The code that is responsible
        for handling this correctly is:
<![CDATA[
<pre>
// make a small time step for the animation during wallclock waiting, but never beyond the next event
// time. Changed 2019-04-30: this is now recalculated based on latest system time after the 'sleep'.
synchronized (super.semaphore)
{
    A nextEventSimTime = nextEvent.getAbsoluteExecutionTime().get();
    R deltaToWall0inSimTime = simulatorTimeForWallClockMillis(
            (System.currentTimeMillis() - wallTime0) * currentSpeedFactor);
    A currentWallSimTime = simTime0.plus(deltaToWall0inSimTime).get();
    if (nextEventSimTime.compareTo(currentWallSimTime) &lt; 0)
    {
        this.simulatorTime.set(nextEventSimTime);

        this.simulatorTime.set(currentWallSimTime);
    }
}
</pre>

      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        The DEVSRealTimeClock got an extra setting: public void setAnimation(final boolean animation). This setting
        indicates whether the animation thread will be started or not. For Web-based applications, the simulation 
        has to be scaled to the real-time clock, but the animation events do not come from the separate
        AnimationThread, but from a timer in the Web application. In tat case setAnimation(false) can be
        called on the DEVSRealTimeClock after constructing it.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        A 'ConcurrentModificationException' on the visibilityMap in the AnimationPanel in dsol-swing has been repaired
        with a 'synchronized' block for its use. The main program thread was still setting the visibility of the
        classes, while the first animation was already iterating over the visibility to see which classes need to 
        be drawn on the screen.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The AnimationThread corrects the time between animation updates for the time it takes to draw the animation.

      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        The DelegateIntrospection has been added to introspection. When an object implements the
        DelegateIntrospection interface, it delegates the introspection to it parent. The implementation
        has been set up that multiple delegations are handled correctly. The function is to provide
        intermediate animation objects the option to delegate the introspection to their parent object.

      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The interface for the InputParameter now forces each parameter to return a getCalculatedValue()
        in addition to the getValue(). This is important, as for the typed selection functions
        using a map, the getValue() returns the map (the value of that parameter), whereas 
        getCalculatedValue() returns the value that can be calculated from the map. This is 
        particularly important for the distribution functions. To enable this and to make it

    <release version="3.02.00" date="2018-09-08" description="DJUNITS time units for the Simulator classes">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        The SimEvent got easy access classes. So you can now, e.g., construct a SimEvent.TimeDouble that
        takes a double as the execution time.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The "easy access" constructors of Treatment and Replication now take parameters in absolute and
        relative time units rather than SimTime. So a new Treatment.TimeDoubleUnit takes as parameters:
        (Time startTime, Duration warmupPeriod, Duration runLength). This is a lot more clear than
        using SimTime wrappers. The general Treatment and Replication constructors still needs a SimTime.
        Extra methods getStartSimTime(), getWarmupSimTime() and getEndSimTime() have been added to the
        Treatment in case the wrapper object are needed, e.g., for comparison or adding/subtracting
        durations.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        Simulator.getSimulatorTime() returns the absolute time A rather than the SimTime T. This makes
        coding a lot easier, as the wrapper T is only used to implement the internals of adding and
        subtracting absolute and relative simulation times, but should actually never be exposed to the
        user, unless the user is really interested in the wrapper. For this, the method
        Simulator.getSimTime() has been implemented, which returns a SimTime object.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        Utilization in dsol-core now uses generics for time.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The Simulator classes do not use the internal TimeUnit classes anymore. Instead, the Time and
        Duration from DJUNITS have been used. This holds for the TimeDoubleUnit, TimeFloatUnit,
        CalendarDouble
        and CalendarFloat. TimeLongUnit has been removed, as it did not really make
        sense how it was implemented. CalendarLong uses a relative Long to indicate time in milliseconds.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        Most of the Model and Simulator methods and constructors do not throw RemoteExceptions anymore.
        RemoteExceptions are only thrown for the Listeners and Context (for the animation), as both of these
        are expected to be Remote sometimes. This means that statistics like Tally, Persistent, and Counter
        throw RemoteExceptions on construction and adding series, as these are dependent on (possibly remote)
        events.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The ImmutableCollections have been updated to avoid accepting a List in the constructor of an ImmutableSet
        when the copyOrWrap is Immutable.WRAP. The size() of the original List and the ImmutableSet
        were different in case of duplicates in the List, which was terribly confusing. Therefore, accepting
        a Collection should always lead to a COPY, whereas a 'compatible' Collection can use the WRAP.
        In addition, wrapping has become a lot more strict. An ImmutableSortedMap wraps only a SortedMap,
        whereas an ImmutableHashMap wraps a Map. Originally, they could wrap each other, leading to
        incompatibilities. The same holds for Lists and Sets.
